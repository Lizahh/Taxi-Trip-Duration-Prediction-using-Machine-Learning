# Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

<<<< The work on this repository is under progress >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<h3> The aim of this project is to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.  </h3> 
<p> Almost all of us have used an Ola or Uber at some point or another to get a ride. Ride-hailing services link local drivers and passengers utilising their personal automobiles through online-enabled platforms. They are often a convenient means of door-to-door transportation. Typically, they are less expensive than utilising authorised taxicabs.
Predicting the duration of a driver's cab occupancy is crucial for optimising the effectiveness of taxi dispatching systems for such services. A dispatcher would be better equipped to choose which driver to assign to each pickup request if they knew roughly when a taxi driver would finish their current trip. </p>
